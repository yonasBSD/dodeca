A fully incremental static site generator.

## Philosophy

**Dev mode = Production mode.** Unlike other static site generators that take shortcuts
in development (skipping minification, using original asset paths, etc.), dodeca serves
exactly what you'll get in production: cache-busted URLs, minified HTML, subsetted fonts,
responsive images—the works. Even font subsetting runs in dev!

This is possible because dodeca uses [Salsa](https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/) for
incremental computation. Every transformation is a cached query. Change a file and only
the affected queries re-run. First page load builds what's needed; subsequent requests
are instant.

**Custom template engine.** Dodeca includes its own Jinja-like template engine. This gives
you the power of a real language (conditionals, loops, variable interpolation) without
the complexity of learning a new syntax. The engine includes rich diagnostics with
line/column information for template errors.

**Plugin architecture.** Dodeca's plugin system (via the `plugcard` crate) allows extending
the build pipeline without modifying the core. Image optimization, CSS processing, syntax
highlighting, and more can be plugged in independently.

## Getting Started

Install dodeca:

```bash
cargo install dodeca
```

Create a new site:

```bash
ddc init my-site
cd my-site
ddc serve
```

This starts a development server at `http://localhost:8080` with live reload.

## Key Features

- **Incremental builds**: Only affected files are re-processed on changes
- **Cache-busted URLs**: Assets get unique names based on content hash
- **Image optimization**: Built-in image processing with responsive variants
- **Font subsetting**: Automatically subset fonts to used characters
- **HTML minification**: Minify HTML in production builds
- **Template engine**: Powerful, easy-to-learn Jinja-like templates
- **Code execution**: Execute code samples and capture output
- **Link checking**: Verify all links in your site
- **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom transformations

## Structure

The dodeca workspace includes:

- **dodeca**: Main SSG binary (`ddc` CLI)
- **gingembre**: Template engine with rich diagnostics
- **plugcard**: Plugin system for extending the build pipeline
- **dodeca-\***: Individual plugins for various transformations
- **livereload-client**: WASM client for live reload in development

## Development

Build everything:

```bash
cargo xtask build
```

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

Build the documentation:

```bash
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --open
```
