Welcome to your first blog post!

## Getting Started

This is an example post to show you the structure. Edit this file at `content/posts/hello-world.md` or create new posts in the same directory.

## Writing Posts

Each post needs frontmatter with at least a title:

```markdown
+++
title = "My New Post"
weight = 10

[extra]
date = "2024-01-15"
author = "Your Name"
+++

Your content here...
```

Posts are sorted by `weight` (lower numbers appear first).

## What's Next?

- Create more posts in `content/posts/`
- Customize the templates in `templates/`
- Add your own styles in `sass/main.scss`

Happy blogging!
