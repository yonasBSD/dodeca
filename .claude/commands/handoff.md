Write a handoff document to `.handoffs/` so a future Claude session can continue your work.

1. Generate a filename using the current date and a short descriptor of the work: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`
2. Create the `.handoffs/` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Write a markdown file containing:
   - **Current State**: What you were working on, what's done, what's in progress
   - **Next Steps**: What remains to be done
   - **Key Files**: Important files the next session should read
   - **Gotchas**: Any non-obvious issues or context
   - **Commands**: Useful commands to run to get started
4. Reply with: "🫡 may I, like the phoenix, rise from my ashes"
