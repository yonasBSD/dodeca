Build automation tasks for the dodeca workspace.

This crate provides custom `cargo xtask` commands to simplify common development workflows:

## Available Tasks

### Build

Build all workspace artifacts including WASM, plugins, and binaries:

```bash
cargo xtask build
```

This:
- Compiles the main `dodeca` binary
- Builds all plugin crates (dodeca-webp, dodeca-sass, etc.)
- Compiles the WASM livereload client
- Generates all necessary artifacts

### Other Tasks

Use `cargo xtask --help` to see all available tasks.

## Notes

The WASM build uses `wasm-bindgen`, and the CI automatically extracts the matching
CLI version from `Cargo.lock` to ensure consistency.
